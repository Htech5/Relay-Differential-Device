# Relay-Differential-Device

Main Program On Keypad.ino

This device functions as a simulator/trainer for detecting short circuits in electrical circuits. It detects the current using PZEM, ACS, and DF Robot sensors, which are processed by an Arduino Mega microcontroller. The output is designed so that if there is an imbalance between current A and current B, the relay will automatically disconnect the power supply.

To use the program above, the user must already have the Keypad I2C, PZEM, and ACS sensor libraries installed.
